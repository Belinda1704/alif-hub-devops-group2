# Alif Hub

> Empowering Somali high school students through mentorship, career guidance, and digital skills.

---

## African Context
Many Somali high school students lack access to mentorship, career guidance, and exposure to technology. This challenge leads to low motivation and limited opportunities for higher education and professional growth. **Alif Hub** addresses this gap by creating a platform where students can connect with mentors, access learning resources, and explore career opportunities—building a future of informed, skilled youth in East Africa.
