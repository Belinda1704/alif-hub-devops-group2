# Alif Mentorship Hub

> A mentorship platform connecting Somali high school students with experienced mentors for career guidance and educational support

## African Context

In many Somali communities, high school students face significant barriers to accessing mentorship and career guidance resources. Limited infrastructure, geographical isolation, and lack of connections to professional networks prevent talented students from realizing their full potential. Alif Mentorship Hub addresses this critical gap by creating a digital platform that democratizes access to mentorship, breaking down geographical and socioeconomic barriers. This platform empowers Somali youth to connect with professionals who understand their cultural context and can provide relevant, meaningful guidance for their educational and career journeys. By leveraging technology, we can transform mentorship from a privilege accessible only to a few into a right available to all motivated students.

## Project Overview

Alif Mentorship Hub is a comprehensive mentorship and learning platform designed to empower Somali high school students (ages 15-20) through career guidance, mentorship programs, and technology training. The application connects students with professionals in software engineering, business, and education to help them discover their potential and access higher education opportunities.

The platform provides secure authentication with role-based access control for both students and mentors. Students can submit mentorship applications with required documents (certificates, transcripts, passport photos, recommendation letters) and track their application status. Mentors receive assigned applications, review student information, and can approve or reject applications while providing feedback. The platform also supports career consultation scheduling and serves as an information hub for scholarships and career paths tailored for Somali students.

Built with modern technologies including React and Django REST Framework, the application ensures a scalable, secure, and user-friendly experience. The responsive design works seamlessly across different devices, making mentorship accessible even in areas with limited internet infrastructure.

### Target Users
